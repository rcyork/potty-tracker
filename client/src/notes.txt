views
- landing/settings - where you add and delete dogs
- main - where you see a snapshot of last let out and also record let outs
- log - where you can view, edit, and delete, logs of let outs

state needed
- dog info: array of objects with names, color, and current number
- log: array of objects representing let outs
- landing page state:
  - new dog object that gets updated on change of text input and radio buttons for color choice
  - when 'add dog' is clicked the new dog object gets passed into the dogs array in state and creates a dog card.  the new dog object then gets emptied
  - deleting a dog card deletes that entry in state


questions: 
 - how to get scrolling log to respect padding of parent element
